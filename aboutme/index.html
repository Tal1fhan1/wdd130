    <h2>Netshi</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone. I am from Johannesburg, South Africa. I recently returned from a full-time mission about a year and a half ago. Now that I am home, I am looking to secure a Bachelor's degree in Applied Technology in order to become a Software Programmer.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include playing instruments (guitar and piano), singing and drawing. I love listening to music. If I could listen to music for every hour of everyday, I probably would. I also enjoy playing video games during my spare time. 
    <p>I have been a member of the Church for 12 years now. My favourite scripture is Alma 36:5. I have a lot of quotes from church leaders that I really like but if I had to pick a favourite, I would have to choose this one from President Russell M. Nelson: â€œThe joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives."</p>
