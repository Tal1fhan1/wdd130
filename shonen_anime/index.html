                Target Audience
              </p>
              <p>
                The main target audience of Shonen is teenagers. There are a lot of shows that feature a teenage protagonist or even an entire cast of teenagers. The lessons that can be learned are also usually geared to teenagers because they teach principles of self-worth, discipline and determination. These are all essential values to have during adolescent due to the fact that most problems that teenagers face are due to a lack of one or more of those values.

                Genres and Themes
              </p>
              <p>
                Most, if not all, of the shows that fall under the Shonen umbrella are heavily focused on fast paced action. That certainly isn't all that there is to it because they also contain elements of other genres sprinkled into them like Sci-fi and fantasy. They all have a wide range of themes that they tackle. Some shows focus on lighter themes like adventure and friendship. Other shows focus on darker themes such as the inevitability of death and futility of life.
