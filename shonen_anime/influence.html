              One word: Kamehameha. Even if you have not watched any Shonen anime, you know exactly what that is. That is the move that every fan of Dragon Ball has tried to do at least once in their life.

              Transformations
            </p></div>
            <p>
              There are a lot of shows that include characters that can transform. Some that immediately comes to mind are Ben 10 and Danny Phantom. As amazing as those shows are, they probably wouldn't even exist if it wasn't inspired by the transformations that were pioneered by shows like Dragon Ball Z. Everyone knows what it means to go 'Super Saiyan'. Sometimes it is even used in everyday conversation to describe someone who surpassed their limits. It is just that iconic.
