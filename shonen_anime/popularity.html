                    <p>There is no denying that some of the most popular and iconic characters in all of fiction are from Shonen Anime. Characters like Goku, Naruto and Luffy, just to name a few, are the dictionary definition of iconic. Chances are, even if you don't recognise their names, you have definitely seen what they look like. Characters in these shows have been written in such a way that anyone can relate to and empathise with them. You get to see them succeed and fail, laugh and cry but most importantly you get to watch them grow and develop.</p>

                    <p>The worlds that these shows take place in are all so unique and memorable. Some of them are worlds that we wish we could live in and some of them we would not want to step foot in. Either way they feel real because they have been built from the ground up to be believable. Even though they are not real, these worlds can sometimes feel more real than our own which is why people get really attached to them.</p>
